# Automatic-Certificate_Generation
Mini-Project(secured first price in MINIPROJECT EXPO 2022 @RMD)

Abstract:
    During this pandemic situation, most institutions recommend online courses.  After completing these courses, certification vendors provide certificates for every individual.  Making these certificates for everyone manually takes a very long time. So we have developed an automatic certificate generator using Python, for this, we have used OS and CV modules to build the code.  By using this we can  automatically generate many numbers of certificates by entering the list of the names as text document.
